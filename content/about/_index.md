## TL;DR ##
I'm an experienced, multi-disciplinary designer working in both digital and print. My strengths are in the visualization of a system from structure and flow to visual and interaction details.

## It all started in a high school graphic arts class ##

Where I discovered my love of putting ink on paper. Though I loved to draw, the printing process opened the world of combining disparate images and type to create something new. I started working in print shops and eventually landed in pre-press working with film and plates. This was also right at the time the Mac was beginning to be used for design and layout.

I got my education in graphic design and started my career working in print and environmental graphics. I was drawn to the shiny new thing, web design, because it was an itersection of design and technology. I've been working primarily on the web ever since. And in that time, I taught myself to write HTML and CSS as well as a little JavaScript. I still consider myself a graphic designer at heart and still design logos, t-shirts, signs, posters, and other analog things. 

## UX, UI, interaction, or visual design? ##

My experience has covered the full spectrum of design from research to production and I don't fit neatly into any one title. I suppose you could call me a design generalist. I love digging in to understand design problems and then bringing the solutions to life through wireframes, mockups and prototypes.

## I bring to the table&hellip; ##
&hellip;a combination of creative and technical skills. My design and problem solving experience includes: concept development, user flows, information architecture, wireframing, interaction design, prototyping, visual design and production.  I&rsquo;m also pretty handy with front end code (html, css, and a bit of javascript) and have made my fair share of git commits. Often without breaking anything.

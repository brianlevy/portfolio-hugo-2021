## Problem ##

Creating and scheduling hero slides to run on the homepage of MSN was time consuming and cumbersome.

Some of the problems facing the users included:

* Existing workflow involved complex repetitive forms.
* Managing multiple duplicate pieces of content.
* Lots of copying and pasting between multiple open browser tabs.
* The overall experience was disconnected with the final display making the identification of individual slides difficult.
* Copy fitting often required a lot of trial and error.

Additionally, after talking with users, it became clear that the two different roles — editors and producers — had different goals and used the tool in different ways. Editors were concerned with the content of slides — the headline and image — while producers were concerned with assembling slides into collections and scheduling those collections to be published onto the homepage. One interface for these very different goals was optimized for neither.

## Solution ##

The foundation of the end design rested on a few basic principles. First, tasks needed to be optimized for each user's goals. This was accomplished by separating the creation workflow from the assembly/scheduling workflow. Second is the concept of "create once, use multiple times". Breaking the content objects into smaller re-usable pieces drastically reduced the amount of duplicate items. Lastly, input should represent the output as close as possible. Having a more visual representation of the elements makes it easier for producers to better identify individual slides at a glance and editors to match headline to image and ensure that copy fits.

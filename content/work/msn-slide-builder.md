## Problem ##
Creating hero slides to run on the homepage of MSN was time consuming and cumbersome.

Some of the main problems facing the users included:

* The overall experience was disconnected with the final display making it impossible to see in advance the end result of the combination of type and image.
* A lot of trial and error was involved in copyfitting and image cropping.
* Existing workflow combined the tasks of creation and scheduling resulting in a tool that was optimized for neither task.

## Solution highlights ##
* [Separated the scheduling workflow](/work/msn-slide-builder/) to focus on the creation workflow.
* WYSIWYG type editing experience ties the input directly to the output to easily see final results.

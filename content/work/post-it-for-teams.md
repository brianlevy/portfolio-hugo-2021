<p>A joint collaboration between Microsoft and 3M to translate one of the Post-it® Brand’s core beliefs -- that all ideas are equal when they’re on the wall -- to our new world of hybrid work​​​​​​​.</p>
  
  <p>The Post-it® App for Teams enhances digital Post-it® Notes with intelligent tools and brings paper Notes into the digital space. Analog notes can be added to a board as easily as digital notes. Intelligence from the M365 platform automatically organizes notes by topic, surfaces relevant content from throughout the organization to aid in research, and identifies tasks to turn ideas into action.</p>

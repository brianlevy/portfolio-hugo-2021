## Project Overview ##
A joint collaboration between Microsoft and 3M to translate one of the Post-it® Brand’s core beliefs -- that all ideas are equal when they’re on the wall -- to our new world of hybrid work​​​​​​​.

The Post-it® App for Teams enhances digital Post-it® Notes with intelligent tools and brings paper Notes into the digital space. Analog notes can be added to a board as easily as digital notes. Intelligence from the M365 platform automatically organizes notes by topic, surfaces relevant content from throughout the organization to aid in research, and identifies tasks to turn ideas into action. 

## My role ##
As part of the Microsoft team, I was responsible for designing the integration of the M365 platform features into the Post-it® app. These features included: General Teams app integration and entry points, automatic Post-it grouping by theme/topic, related content, task identification/assignment, and in-meeting analog note capture.

* Coordinated and led design efforts for co-innovation projects, working directly with Microsoft customers
* Facilitated ideation and brainstorming sessions with customers to build domain knowledge and understanding of the problem space.
* Translated output from ideation and working sessions into concept designs, user flows, and mockups, and prototypes.
* Presented concepts, designs, and ideas with customers and internal stakeholders.
* Worked closely with development team to ensure fidelity to design vision and standards.
